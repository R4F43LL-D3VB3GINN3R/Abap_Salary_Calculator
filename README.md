LVL1

Create an ABAP program that allows the user to calculate the total salary of an employee based on the base salary, overtime hours, and deductions. Use different types of variables to store the values and perform the  
calculations.  
  
Prompt the user to input the following information:  
  
Monthly base salary  
Overtime hours worked (in hours)  
Deduction amount (e.g., for taxes or other deductions) 
Calculate the gross salary (base salary + overtime value) and the net salary (gross salary - deduction).  
  
Display the following results on the screen:  
  
Base salary  
Overtime hours   
Deduction  
Gross salary  
Net salary

LVL2

Create an ABAP program that allows the user to calculate the total salary of an employee with additional complexity. The program should be based on the base salary, overtime hours, and deductions, utilizing different  
types of variables for storing values and performing calculations.  

Prompt the user to input the following information:  

Monthly base salary  
Overtime hours worked (in hours)  
Value of deductions (e.g., for taxes or other deductions)  
Additional Allowances (e.g., for bonuses or incentives)  
Percentage of Bonus (expressed as a decimal)  
Tax Rate (expressed as a decimal)  
Calculate the gross salary (base salary + value of overtime hours) and the net salary (gross salary - deductions). Then, apply additional allowances and calculate the final salary after accounting for the bonus and taxes. 

Display the following results on the screen:  

Employee Name  
Base Salary  
Overtime Hours  
Deductions  
Gross Salary  
Bonus Amount  
Allowances  
Net Salary  
  
Implement the necessary logic to calculate the bonus, apply taxes, and determine the net salary after considering all the components.  

This advanced version of the program introduces more complex calculations, such as applying allowances, calculating bonuses based on a percentage, and applying taxes. It provides a comprehensive example of how to handle   various components that affect an employee's salary.

Develop an ABAP program that allows the user to calculate the total salary of an employee with even greater complexity. The program should be based on the base salary, overtime hours, and deductions, using different variable types to store values and perform intricate calculations.

Prompt the user to input the following information:

Monthly base salary
Overtime hours worked (in hours)
Value of deductions (e.g., taxes, health insurance, contributions)
Additional benefits (e.g., bonuses or incentives)
Bonus Percentage (expressed as a decimal)
Tax Rate (expressed as a decimal)
Calculate the gross salary (base salary + value of overtime hours). Next, calculate the total deductions (deduction value + calculated taxes). Determine the bonus amount based on the gross salary and bonus percentage. Finally, calculate the net salary after considering all components.

Display the following results in an organized manner:

Employee Name
Base Salary
Overtime Hours
Total Deductions
Gross Salary
Bonus Amount
Benefits
Net Salary

Implement the necessary logic to calculate the bonus, apply taxes, and determine the net salary considering all components.

This advanced version of the program introduces more intricate calculations, such as applying varying bonus percentages, handling different overtime rates (e.g., holidays or weekends), and detailed tax calculations based on salary ranges. It offers a comprehensive example of dealing with various components that impact an employee's salary, along with enhanced output detailing the calculations made.

By incorporating additional complexities, this exercise will provide you with a robust understanding of ABAP programming in a practical payroll context.
