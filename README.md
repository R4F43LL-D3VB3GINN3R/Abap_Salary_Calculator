LVL2

Create an ABAP program that allows the user to calculate the total salary of an employee with additional complexity. The program should be based on the base salary, overtime hours, and deductions, utilizing different  
types of variables for storing values and performing calculations.  

Prompt the user to input the following information:  

Monthly base salary  
Overtime hours worked (in hours)  
Value of deductions (e.g., for taxes or other deductions)  
Additional Allowances (e.g., for bonuses or incentives)  
Percentage of Bonus (expressed as a decimal)  
Tax Rate (expressed as a decimal)  
Calculate the gross salary (base salary + value of overtime hours) and the net salary (gross salary - deductions). Then, apply additional allowances and calculate the final salary after accounting for the bonus and taxes. 

Display the following results on the screen:  

Employee Name  
Base Salary  
Overtime Hours  
Deductions  
Gross Salary  
Bonus Amount  
Allowances  
Net Salary  
  
Implement the necessary logic to calculate the bonus, apply taxes, and determine the net salary after considering all the components.  

This advanced version of the program introduces more complex calculations, such as applying allowances, calculating bonuses based on a percentage, and applying taxes. It provides a comprehensive example of how to handle   various components that affect an employee's salary.
